<h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
<p>brief details of who did what</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Simranjeet Singh: </strong> Done the work myself, researched online for finding the solutions for various problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p> I put all my efforts in designing and implementig the ideas, the website is completed in a short span of time, because i also had to focus on learning many other topics of our interests.
 The webpages are interlinked correctly and can directly be opened from the navigation menu.<br/> The <strong>outstanding issues</strong> are: <ul><li>The Newsfeed page contents are not synced with time, we tried and failed to add this functionality.</li>
 <li>I wanted the header to be static when the user scrolls down the pages, So it may not be suitable for screens with low hieght.</li>
 <li>All the images used in my website are copied from google images. Some images may look irrelevant to describe the topic.</li>
 <li>In order to make omy website look good and proffessional, I have added a few fake links in my website. These links redirect the user to current# page.</li></ul></p>
<h2>References</h2>
<p>references (links) for any code, images or content that you have used that are not your own</p>
<ul>
    
    <li><strong>The customization approach is inpired from </strong> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css">W3schools</a>. This website was also reffered for other minor help</li>
    <li><strong>The website structure and some of the content is based on </strong> <a href="http://www.nqorchestra.com.au">nqorchestra.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>PMI</h2>

<p> My experience of working  was very good. It has added many new things to my knowledge base. The website development work sometimes required  to find the solution for the same problem. </p>

<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> The communication among the team members was not good during the entire development work. One member alone doing all work not distributing work equally.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong>  The About Us page does not include year wise reports of the work at orchestra. The History of the orchestra is not elaborated enough. I have written most of the content by myself. So it may look unproffessional in comparison to the actual website.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> I am amazed to see my own website after the completion of the development phase. Initially, I am not very good at designing and development. We all have learned by trial and error method. Now we can say that we can attempt to develop another website on our own.</p>
